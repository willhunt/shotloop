# Shot Loop
PID temperature control added to a Rancillio Silvia espresso machine with app control to turn the machine on and off for pre-warming.
Used as final project for CS50 computer science course through edX (https://www.edx.org).

## Implementation
PID temperature control implemented using Arduino and app develped for Android using Android Studio and Java

## CS50 submission
For on overview of functionality here was my project submission video for the CS50 course (2015):
